# Thank you for using LagStop!
# LagStop is a ROBLOX anti-lag that powers down on quality of any sort to try and gain the FPS back. 
# All changes upon lag are hopefully local to not affect the players that aren't lagging.
# Do be aware of any malicious copies as some may start copying the model and adding backdoors.
