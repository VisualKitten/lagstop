# Thank you for using LagStop!
LagStop is a ROBLOX anti-lag that powers down on quality of any sort to try and gain the FPS back. 
All changes upon lag are hopefully local to not affect the players that aren't lagging.
Do be aware of any malicious copies as some may start copying the model and adding backdoors.
